 📖 About Me :man_technologist:

I am a Software Developer with a strong foundation in Embedded Systems and Cutting-Edge Technologies. I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Mid Sweden University, where I specialized in software development for embedded systems, real-time applications, and system optimization. This comprehensive background enables me to develop high-performance, reliable, and scalable software solutions for embedded applications across various industries.

🏋️‍♂️ Beyond Code

Outside work, I enjoy hanging out with friends, attending tech meetups, exploring new places, and engaging in social activities. I’m always eager to tinker, experiment, and learn about the latest software and embedded systems advancements.
